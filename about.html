As an amateur you have an advantage over photographers – you can do as you wish… This should make amateurs the happiest of photographers.” Andreas Feininger</p>


<p>The incentive for picking up photography was the beautiful B/W photograph of a friend of mine. The uncommon light guide and the presence of high contrast in the tonal values in his B/W pictures show familiar or unknown situations and places under a new and aesthetic point of view.</p>

<p>I’m doing photography as an amateur for about 5 years now and I really appreciate the creative balance to my rather top-heavy and rational office job. Being free from any commitment but to myself I can really discover the world’s smaller and larger objects with my lenses. Another benefit of photography is that I slowly have changed my way of looking at things and I have started to see details which before I would never have even considered. During photographing it can easily happen, that I’m so deeply focused on my objects that I easily forget time. To me the fact that photography enhances the visual perception of the world around you and make you live the moment more intensely makes photography a really valuable thing, because it forms a very good contrast to the fast and sometimes superficial modern world.</p>

<p>At the beginning I was using a higher-end compact camera the Nikon Coolpix D7000. After a while the flexibility of changeable lenses on a DSLR was too tempting and I bought a Pentax K-5 II. On the Photokina 2014 in Cologne Germany, there were several mirrorless APC camera presented for hands-on trial and among others also the Fuji XT-1. I really liked the big electronic viewfinder and the vintage feel and look of this camera. The lenses available for the X-mount are very well fabricated and have interesting optical features such as focal length and high maximal aperture. So I decided to sell the Pentax K-5 II and buy the Fuji XT-1. I was surely also satisfied with the features of the Pentak K-5 II but at that time I had a good opportunity to sell the Pentax for good money and I prefer the electronic viewfinder to the optical.</p>

<p>I like to photograph all sort of things, but the objects which inspire me the most is the geometric and abstract aspects of modern architecture, the unusual and often abstract world unfolded by the macro photography of flowers and other natural and manmade objects. The different facial expressions and behavior of animals, in particular in nature but also in parks or zoos, I like to capture as well. Last but not least I’m also interested in shooting pictures of beautiful landscapes, especially in golden and blue hours of the morning or evening light.</p>

<p>Apart from photography itself I’m interested in digital post processing of my pictures with Adobe Lightroom or Gimp. I’m not only interested in using these programs but also in the approaches and algorithm behind the scenes.</p>

<p>The aim of my website is to share my experience during my photo trips. Most of the people are proud of their work and creation which is also the case for me. I’m aware that there are  many better photographs out there or with the words of Henri Henri Cartier-Bresson:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Your first 10’000 photographs are your worst.”</p>
<p>And I’m happy to show these my first 10’000 photographs nevertheless, because I still felt the need to show my pictures in gallery of an own website which is a more personal and persistent way compared to showing the pictures on social media platforms such as Flickr and Facebook.</p>
