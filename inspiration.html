Apart from the nicely written articles the design and navigation of his website is really good as well.

The website is hosted by the German family Reicherts which is a couple of photographer and travel-journalist with their 3 children. They are regularly on shorter or longer trips all around the word and they write about their experiences in real time from their journeys. The blog articles contain good information with well-done pictures and are also an excellent basis for preparation and planning holidays.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dpreview.com/">dpreview</a> (EN): This is a technical review website where new cameras, lenses and accessories are tested. Their approach in order to evaluate lenses or camera is very comprehensive and from a very technical point of view. In particular their articles about new cameras and lenses are usually 7-8 pages long and not that easy to understand for people who are unfamiliar with technical aspects of the photography, however, the nice thing about their review is that they are fact-based and with their opinion they try to be as un-biased as possible. This website is surely a good source for more detailed information if you are about to buy a new camera or lens or if you like to know more about the performance and options of your new camera. Even more, the authors regularly give a buying guide about different categories of cameras.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.de/Art-Photography-Approach-Expression-Photographic/dp/1933952687">The Art of Photography</a> (EN): In this book US photographer Bruce Barnbaum talks about the creative process of photography and means to develop its own creativity. There is also a chapter about analog photo processing and the author emphasize that in his opinion it helps to understand the digital photo processing when you know the basic of the analog approach because many tools of digital processing programs are named after steps in the analog process. Furthermore, he introduces the Zone System developed by the photograph Ansel Adams which was originally invented for analog photography and the author shows how the Zone System can be applied to the digital photography as well. The book itself is very nice designed and it is illustrated with really nice B/W photos of Bruce Barnbaum, so the book itself is an eye candy already. Conclusion: This book is a good reference if you are rather new to photography and you would like to learn more about photography, but also fourth to buy if you just want to have a book with very good B/W photos.</p>
